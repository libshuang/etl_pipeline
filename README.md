This project is to build a production-grade ETL pipeline that covers the platforms: Apache Airflow, AWS S3, Snowflake, and dbt.

We will achieve to meet the criteria of scalability, auditability, security, modularity, orchestration, and compliance efforts followed by enterprise firms.

We will be scaling 2 types of data pulls: Existing large CSVs and API data.

This is the Stack Overview:

Layer		Tool			Purpose
Ingestion	AWS S3			Raw data storage
Transformation	dbt (with Snowflake)	Declarative SQL modeling
Orchestration	Apache Airflow		DAG-based task automation
Data Warehouse	Snowflake		Centralized, secure data store
Validation	Great Expectations	Data quality checks
Monitoring	Airflow + Slack/Datadog	Alerting, logging
Visualization	Tableau/Power BI	Analytics dashboarding

Steps:
1. Store the required data in an S3 bucket with using json and Parquet
2. Use an Airflow DAG to ingest raw csv files from S3 into a schema in Snowflake (Extract)
3. Use dbt to standardize the schema, document the business model, and develop the models (Transform)
4. Data Validation
5. Load data for BI and Analytics (Load)
6. Orchestration with Airflow DAG

Compliance Efforts:
Audit: Logs all ETL steps in Airflow and Snowflake
Version Control: All dbt models and DAGs in Git
Monitoring: Alerts on DAG failures via Slack
Access Controls: S3 IAM roles, Snowflake RBAC
